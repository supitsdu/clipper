To build Clipper from source, you'll need to have Go installed on your system, as well as the Make tool.

### Requirements

- **Make Tool:** Building Clipper from source requires the Make tool to automate the build process. Make is commonly pre-installed on Unix-like systems, but you may need to install it manually on Windows.

```sh
make
```

This command will build binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS in the `bin` directory.
